# Getting Data Into Sentinel
After the Sentinel Deployment, if we go to the incidents tab on the left we see we donâ€™t have any incidents currently as there is no data being fed into sentinel. Next, we are going to utilize data connectors and create a data collection rule to bring in data from our Windows 10 VM.

Go to the Data connectors Tab. This is where we can select the type of data that we want to bring into our SIEM.
